# ðŸ§  AI Text Summarizer

An advanced AI-powered summarization tool designed to efficiently condense content from Text, PDFs, and URLs, utilizing two state-of-the-art summarization techniques.

## Summarization Techniques:
- **Extractive Summarization (BERT-based)**:

This method extracts key sentences or phrases directly from the original text to create a concise summary. It aims to capture the most relevant information by identifying significant content in the source material.  
  **Ideal for**: Getting a condensed version of the original content without rephrasing or altering the meaning.

- **Abstractive Summarization (BART Transformer)**:

A more advanced approach that generates a summary by paraphrasing and rephrasing the input text. The model generates novel sentences that convey the most important information, similar to how humans summarize content.  
  **Ideal for**: Producing summaries that are more coherent and natural-sounding, even when the original text has complex or lengthy information.
  
## Key Features:
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Utilize state-of-the-art models such as **BART** and **BERT** for high-quality summaries.
- **Gradio UI**: An intuitive user interface for seamless interaction with the summarization tool.
- **Multiple Input Formats**: Easily summarize content from various sourcesâ€”whether plain text, PDF files, or web URLs.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Adjust the length or ratio of the summary to suit your needs.
